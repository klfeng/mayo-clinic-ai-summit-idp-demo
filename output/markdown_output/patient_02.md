Specimen : 


Comment : 

1. INR is the parameter of choice in monitoring adequacy of oral anticoagulant therapy. Appropriate therapeutic range varies with the disease and treatment intensity 
2. Prolonged INR suggests potential bleeding disorder / bleeding complications 
3. Results should be clinically correlated 
4. Test conducted on Citrated plasma 

RecommendedTherapeutio range for Oral Anticoagulant therapy INR 2.0-3.0 Treatment of Venous thrombosis & Pulmonary embolism- Prophylaxis of Venous thrombosis (High risk surgery) Prevention of systemic embolism in tissue heart valves, AMI, Valvular heart disease & Atrial fibrillation- Bileaflet mechanical valve in aortic position INR 2.5-3.5: Mechanical prosthetic valves Comments: Systemic recurrent emboli Prothrombin time measures the extrinsic coagulation pathway which consists of activated Factor VII (Vlla), Tissue factor and Proteins of the common pathway (Factors X, V, Il & Fibrinogen). This assay is used to control long term oral anticoagulant therapy, evaluation of liver function & to evaluate coagulation disorders specially factors involved in the extrinsic pathway like Factors V, VII, X, Prothrombin & Fibrinogen.
